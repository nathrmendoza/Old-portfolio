				<h1>Background</h1>
				<p>My work revolves around creating simple designs and programming. I tend to focus more on the programming aspect. 
					My workflow involves creating simple assets or designs and implmenting code to make them functional when 
					creating either games or web apps.</p>

						<p>Among these three languages, javascript was the most time consuming. I studied javascript for the requirement

						<h1>Software and Tools</h1>
						<p>For the extent of my time in college, we were taught various software and tools that benefited us in each of our 
							specializations. These software ranged from simple text editors to IDE's, from paint to Photoshop. If I were 
							to list all the software we've used I would've broken a principle in web design. So instead, read my resume.</p>
